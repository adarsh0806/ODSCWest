## Knowledge Mining: How Topic Modeling can Help Build the Knowledge Graph of Data Science, Scott Le Grand Senior Scientist at Teza Technologies ##

Latent Dirichlet Allocation

* Does not always work for topic modeling.

Additive Regularization for Topic Modeling(ARTM)

* Max log likelihood with additive combination of regularizers
* You can consider not just text features but also see author, time, comments data.
* Works better than LDA
* Create knowledge graph
