What is NN

* It is a fxn that can learn.
* Weight parameters, bias units
* We let the computer try to find the best weights and bias
* Gradient descent/ADAM/Adagraph are the optimizers used
* Each neuron does linear classification
* Hidden layers map inputs to a feature space to classify with a hyperplane - hidden layers act as a converging layer which tries to extract only the most important parts of the dataset to solve the problem at hand.

DL at Google

* RankBrain: DL based ranking algorithm
* WaveNet: used to make music
* CloudVision API
* CloudSpeech API
* [Google cloud docs](cloud.google.com)
* TensorBoard - visualizing TensorFlow perf
